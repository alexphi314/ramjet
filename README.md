# ramjet

This is the code for the final project of AE 225: Introduction to Gas Dynamics. Using Rayleigh Flow, Fanno Flow, Normal and Oblique shock behavior, and Isentropic relations, this code models the flow conditions through a ramjet engine. This model is then used to design a ramjet engine, adjusting engine parameters to generate required thrust, exit temperature, and inlet efficiency. This was a collaborative project -- this code was written by Alex Philpott, Ethen Daniels, and Dylan Ma.
